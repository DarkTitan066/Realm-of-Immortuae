# Realm-of-Immortuae
This is my pet project for making a website for my server. All pages include a navbar and a scrole to top button.
The index.html includes the home page with some useful information on the website displayed in cards.
The contact.html page includes some offsite ways to contact us as well as a form to fill out to get into contact with us. There is also a faq using the accordion funtion.
The about.html is a page to show all the staff of the server using a table funtion.
The donation.html page is here to show the different ways people can donate to our server offsite.
The app.js is not linked to the page but holds all of the javascript inbedded in the pages.
